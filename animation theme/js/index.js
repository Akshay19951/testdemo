//  another one stunning illustration by my lovely Lina, another one milestone for our team's dribbble account, so I decided to give it  a shot and animate this one in a classic css/svg  way.
// everything here is prepared in illustrator and exported to svg 
// fire sequence is hand-crafted by Lina also,  animated simply by using svg sprite and <foreignobject>
// no real known issues except my one and only, loving Firefox. I really love this browser, but it is a real pain to deal with svg animations and filters in it.  Firefox deals strangely with filters and foreignobject here, I know.
